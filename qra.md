# QRA (Quantitative Reasoning Associate)

We are very fortunate to have a student QRA (Quantitative Reasoning
Associate) providing extra help with this course. Our QRA is John Chu
(chuj@dickinson.edu). John will be holding office hours to assist with
homework and understanding of course concepts, and may also be
available at other times by appointment.
