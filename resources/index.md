Today's PowerPoint (same as last time): [09-finite-automata.pptx](class10/09-finite-automata.pptx).

Optionally, you can gain familiarity with pumping lemma proofs by playing a game within JFLAP. Choose "regular pumping lemma" from the initial JFLAP window. Then choose "computer goes first" (the "you go first" option is also interesting and useful, but we don't explain it further here). Choose one of the languages. Now your job is to force the computer to violate the pumping lemma. JFLAP's notation is as follows: _m_ is the pumping cutoff; _w_ is the string in the language that will have some substring pumped; _i_ is the number of times _w_ will have a substring pumped; _w_ gets partitioned as _w=XYZ_ where _Y_ is the substring to be pumped.

## Class 10

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 9, sections 9.1-9.4.

Today's PowerPoint: [09-finite-automata.pptx](class10/09-finite-automata.pptx).

In-class JFLAP activity: [activity-class10.docx](class10/activity-class10.docx).

## Class 9

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 8.

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup09.docx](class09/warmup09.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [08-nondeterminism.pptx](class09/08-nondeterminism.pptx).

## Class 8

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 7, sections 7.6-end.

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup08.docx](class08/warmup08.docx)

Today's PowerPoint (same as last time, starting on slide 13): [07-reductions.pptx](class07/07-reductions.pptx).
 
## Class 7

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 7, sections 7.1-7.5.

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup07.docx](class07/warmup07.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [07-reductions.pptx](class07/07-reductions.pptx).


## Class 6

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6.

Today's PowerPoint: [06-universal-programs.pptx](class06/06-universal-programs.pptx).

Really nice online [cellular automaton simulator](https://devinacker.github.io/celldemo/).

Optional minilab (ungraded, but important and fun):

*   Download the [Universal Turing machine](class06/tu.jff) of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their [explanatory webpage](http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html) if you're interested).
*   Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the previous class, but using only the alphabet `a,b` (and blanks). If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of [LastBtoA](class06/LastBtoA.jff). We will use LastBtoA as an input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
*   Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine. An [explanation of the encoding](class06/example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf) is provided. Lucas and Jarvis provide [another explanation](http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html) on their website.
*   Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.



## Class 5

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 5.

To download JFLAP, follow the instructions at [jflap.org](http://jflap.org/getjflap.html) (you will be asked to fill out a short form). The best version for this course is JFLAP7.1.jar from Jul 27, 2018.

**If the JFLAP website is down you can get [JFLAP on Moodle](https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=1172511) instead**

**If JFLAP won't run when you click on it, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you have saved the file `JFLAP7.1.jar`, then enter the command**
```
java -jar JFLAP7.1.jar
```
(Of course, you need to have Java installed on your computer for this to work.)

Minilab (ungraded): using JFLAP,

*   experiment with [binary-incrementer.jff](binary-incrementer.jff)
*   Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (fig 5.3)
*   Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (fig 5.6)
*   Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings, changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
*   Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of length 10 or more that also contains an "a".

Today's PowerPoint: [05-turing-machines.pptx](class05/05-turing-machines.pptx).

## Class 4

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 4.

Today's warm-up exercise: [04-warmup.docx](class04/04-warmup.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [04-computational-problems.pptx](class04/04-computational-problems.pptx).

Programs for experimenting with ESS and DESS: [switchAndConcat.py](class04/switchAndConcat.py), [switchAndConcat1Param.py](class04/switchAndConcat1Param.py). (Remember to move these into your `wcbc-programs-v1.1` folder.)

## Class 3

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 3.

Handout for today: [class3-handout.pdf](class03/class3-handout.pdf).

Today's warm-up exercise: [03-warmup.docx](class03/03-warmup.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [03-impossible-programs.pptx](class03/03-impossible-programs.pptx).

## Class 2

Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC.

Today's PowerPoint: [02-computer-programs.pptx](class02/02-computer-programs.pptx).

## Class 1

The textbook is called *What Can Be Computed?*, which we abbreviate as
    *WCBC*.
      
Today we will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course,
corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1.

Today's PowerPoint: [01-intro.pptx](class01/01-intro.pptx).
  
If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs
  using IDLE. Key points:

* Always use Version 3.x of Python for this course
* You can [download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
    install it on your own laptop etc.
* Python is also available on all department iMacs in Tome:
  - use the search functionality (top right of the desktop) to open
      IDLE with Version 3.x of Python
  - you can ignore any warnings about the version of Tcl/Tk

Another option is to use an online Python environment such
as [https://repl.it/new/python3](https://repl.it/new/python3). Here
  is some code to paste in and experiment with:
```	
def containsGAGA(inString): 
    if 'GAGA' in inString: 
        return 'yes' 
    else: 
        return 'no' 
```

Here's another one:
```
def multiply(inString): 
    (M1, M2) = inString.split()
    product = int(M1) * int(M2) 
    return str(product)
```
