# Homework assignments

The number of points assigned to a problem is a very approximate guide
to the number of minutes it should take to solve the problem (e.g. a
10-point question should take approximately 10 minutes). As stated on
the syllabus, some questions will be graded on correctness and some on
completeness. Only a random subset of questions will be graded at
all. Solutions are provided on Moodle and it is the student's
responsibility to check the solutions to all questions.

Assignments must be submitted in hard copy. Handwritten solutions are
acceptable. Questions must be clearly numbered and must be presented
in the order of the assignment.

You can use the [homework revision cover
sheet](hw-revision-cover-sheet.pdf) to earn back 50% of the points you
lost on any assignment. You can do this for every assignment if you
want. (Exception: sorry, but you cannot submit a revision for homework
assignment J.) Revisions for homework assignments must be submitted
within two weeks of the graded assignment being returned, or by the
end of the exam period, whichever is earlier.

Assignments:

*   [homework assignment A](hwA.pdf)
*   [homework assignment B](hwB.pdf)
*   [homework assignment C](hwC.pdf)
*   [homework assignment D](hwD.pdf)
*   [homework assignment E](hwE.pdf)
*   [homework assignment F](hwF.pdf)
*   [homework assignment G](hwG.pdf)
*   [homework assignment H](hwH.pdf)
*   [homework assignment J](hwJ.pdf). Note that there is no homework
    assignment "I". (Airlines and theaters often do the same thing --
    seats go straight from H to J, to avoid "I" which looks too much
    like the numeral "1".) This assignment comes with a free one-day
    extension -- submit by 11:59pm on the last Friday of classes.
